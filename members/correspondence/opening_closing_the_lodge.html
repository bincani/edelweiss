<h1>Opening / Closing the Lodge</h1>
<p>
Now that the season is open, it is probably a good time to review the Cabin Opening & Closing Procedures.
<p>
All of the info can be found in the booklet by the front door.
<p>
In general:
<li>please ensure the water is turned OFF so the pipes don't freeze.....if there is someone coming in within a day of you leaving it is OK to leave the water on
<li>please endure the place is clean & ready for the next guests
<li>please leave the Main gas ON (this is the valve outside the lodge behind the back rooms), but turn OFF all the other gas valves (ski room, hot water etc). Again if there is someone arriving within a day of you leaving it is OK to leave the gas fully on.
<p>We are very lucky that Carolyn has agreed to help us again with opening / closing the lodge this season.
