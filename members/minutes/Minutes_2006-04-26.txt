Presidents Report:

(Ranald McCowan)

* New membership applications are moving along, accepted 2 applications, and
  there is a 3rd and maybe 4th in the pipeline. It will be discussed later
  whether we would keep the application period open.
* New booking system has been settling down, and people are now checking who is
  using the cabin and making bookings on line. Members need to pay their
  deposit or loose their booking. We can make payments online.
* Improving the club facilities through 2 work parties. Thankyou to Peter Smith
  for organising and running the work parties. The cabin now has new carpet
  thanks to Peter Smith, Kerry Harry, and the Browns (new members)
* Cabin redevelopment plans are currently on hold waiting to see how the
  mountain develops. We are watching the Maritz development to see what
  unfolds. Andrew and Ranald will be talking with the Maritz developers.
* Next meeting is the AGM and is time for a change of officers. Looking for a
  new President and Cabin Manager.


Treasures Report:

(Judy McCowan)

* Anz has $40K
* We have spent $10K this year
* Westpac signatories have not yet been changed over, and some reimbersment is
  required.
* Internet banking - Judy needs more information when you send money, even if
  it is just your intitials.
* New members need to pay membership fees before they can book.
* Membership fees must be paid within 30 days of the AGM.


Cabin Manager's Report:

(Peter Smith)

* The Easter work party was attended by The Brown's (new members) and Kerry
  Harry. Two days of snow and foul weather, however, we managed to clean up a
  lot of items.
* Outstanding items not completed are as follows:


  1. Paint decking rails and seats
  2. Stabilise roof support and rear wall
  3. Install 2 new toilets
  4. New vinyl, pantry, HWS room, toilet and shower rooms


* New Year's Work Party, suggest the following for the future Cabin Manager:


  1. Replace all ceiling lights - electrician required
  2. Reading lights in bedrooms and lounge - electrician required
  3. Purchase airing rack
  4. Purchase front loader washing machine and install in HWS room - note
     remove existing lockers and replace with metal due vermin access to lodge
     through existing lockers.
  5. Purchase electric clothes dryer and install in cold porch
  6. Purchase oven mitts
  7. Purchase communal hair dryer
  8. Purchase vegetable peelers
  9. Purchase long handle window squeegee
 10. Purchase cork mats for hot food service


* Agenda item for next meeting
* Current summer rates: overnight rate is too expensive and has not encouraged
  occupancy;
* Either:


  1. Lower summer rates for members and guests

Or

  1. Reward members (not guests) by crediting the equivalent in overnight
     occupancy to the annual membership fee. This has the following advantages:


* Members will use the lodge to work off "credit" i.e. a loyalty reward
* Members may bring paying guests to the club's advantage.
* The present system is not producing a financial gain for the club.



* Peter Smith is very impressed with the Maritz building developers. Will be
  meeting with them tommorow night.
* Alpine fire extingishes has told us that we have to have 2 checks each year.
* A gas log fire would require $1000 to install.
* European wasp nest somewhere around the cabin
* The Sewerage will be pumped out for free, since we are not on the standard
  infrastructure.




General Business:


* Ingrid has brought in some forms for "Get fit to ski" classes ($198).
* Membership Subcommittee


  1. Membership application of the Gray's. Kerry proposed, Peter seconded.
     Passed. Ranald will write to inform them.
  2. Final decision as to accepting new member applications will be made at the
     AGM.


* Summer use of the cabin


  1. Peter would like to discuss reducing the fees at the AGM.



* Booking System


  1. Working well


* Other Business


  1. Children of new members. Between 18 and 21 they can transfer to Full A
     membership, by paying 3 times the annual subscription fee and the current
     years sub fee. Junior members can not take guests up.
  2. At the AGM we would like to decide to always set the cabin fees in the
     December meeting for the following year. This allows for the cabin
     attendance to be reviewed after the ski season.
