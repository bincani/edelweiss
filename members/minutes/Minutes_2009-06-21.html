Whilst we would have liked to have attended the Hotham board meeting, circumstances (a bleeding patient) meant that Hamish was unable to attend, and unfortunately Martin Brown did not receive an email from the Hotham Board letting him know when it was on. What could be determined, however, is due to the financial crisis things have slowed down at Hotham. </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P2">Treasurers report:</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Financial Report of Assets and Liabilities were tabled, comparing 2008/9 with previous 5 years.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Total expenditure was $21327.58. Total income for the year was $33905.91.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Subscriptions indicate the withdrawing of one member.  We have one new member, one upgraded member and one new spouse member.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Expenditure demonstrates a general increase for all regular sources of services, eg, electricity, gas, insurance, Mt Hotham Board of Management.</p><p class="P1">Costs, however, for maintenance were considerably lower than in 2007/8. Two new very successful purchases are the rubbish hutch and a really good vacuum cleaner.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Current account balances: Westpac $25360, ANZ $87579.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Cabin usage income was down; $10828 in 2008/9 cf $13958 in 2007/8.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">In general subscriptions for 2009/2010 should be raised marginally to reflect CPI, new fees will be $410 ($400) for members, $65 ($60) for spouse members (Pete Smith, seconded by Hamish Farrow, and passed).</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Overseas members $100, work party levy $60 . </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Membership renewal notices will be sent out in August to be paid by the end of September. A late fee of $60 will apply.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Online payments are preferred and are generally working well.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Bill Farrow continues doing a wonderful job enabling the booking the calendar to work so smoothly, however email communication with him (and Judy McCowan) remains essential when payments are made.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">The treasurer’s report was accepted (proposed by Andrew Gray, seconded by Nancy Black)</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P2">Cabin managers report:</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P3">ITEM 1: A break in was discovered by Kerry Harry and reported to Mt Hotham</p><p class="P3">Police and Mt Hotham Management. It was the only break in that either</p><p class="P3">organization was aware of this season. The rear door was forcibly opened</p><p class="P3">with damage to the door frame in the vicinity of the two locking bolts.</p><p class="P3">Kerry affected a temporary repair with the matter to be fully addressed at</p><p class="P3">the next work party.</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3">ITEM 2: Our pre season Bi annual inspection is complete and the paperwork</p><p class="P3">and invoice slow to be on forwarded to the club from Paul Mansfield and</p><p class="P3">Brian Taggart (Electrician) I will on forward the inspection certificate to</p><p class="P3">Alpine Shire-a copy of which is to be displayed in the lodge.</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3">ITEN 3: Cabin expenses- with no work party this pre season due bushfires,</p><p class="P3">our outgoings on maintenance will be minimal. Wooden coat hangers have been installed to replace the plastic ones, and new tea towels. Please use the</p><p class="P3">new gas lighters to light the oven. No other problems with the lodge have</p><p class="P3">been reported.</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3">ITEM 4: Conversations with Greg ODonohue MHMC Manager trails and Grooming and also CFA re the clearing around the lodge in spring- he may be able to supply a contractor, also Kerry has a contractor who has expressed interest.</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3">$500 was voted as appropriate to fund what will now be an annual spring</p><p class="P3">requirement by MHMC.</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3">Also Greg has made us aware of probable changes to the building code to</p><p class="P3">fireproof the lodge against ember and spark attacks during the fire season-</p><p class="P3">this will be further discussed at the end of the snow season and Martin and</p><p class="P3">I will meet personally with him at Mt Hotham in October-we will stock take</p><p class="P3">and shut down the lodge at the same time. New building regulations will be</p><p class="P3">issued as a result of the Royal Commission and will be the subject of</p><p class="P3">further discussion at the next club meeting.</p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3">ITEM 5: Repairs that are required at times other than our annual work party</p><p class="P3">must first be approved by the Cabin Manager. The club has an obligation to</p><p class="P3">our insurer to maintain a safe environment for the membership and</p><p class="P3">centralized control is the only effective way to meet our responsibility.</p><p class="P3">Please notify the Cabin Manager in the first instance. Shortages of club</p><p class="P3">supplies should also be reported, such that immediate restocking can be</p><p class="P3">effected. </p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1">In addition, the club has purchased a rubbish hutch, and Dyson vacuum cleaner. Andrew Gray reported that the sled is broken, and that the cushions by the tables need Velcro.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">The cabin managers report was accepted (proposed by Chris Politz, seconded by Martin Brown).</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1">The AGM was closed</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P2">Ongoing business:</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Sam Harry has relinquished his membership.
