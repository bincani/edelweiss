Presidents Report:

(Ranald McCowan)

* Quiet time of the year
* Reduced summer rates to increase cabin usage. Fires may have reduced
  cabin useage. We need to encourage people to use the cabin during
  the summer.
* Wondering how cabin usage for the next snow season will work out.
  Some week long bookings have been made, but there are not too many
  bookings.
* Most Hotham correspondance are bills.
* New memberships have not had an impact on the cabin bookings so far.
* Maritz developers may talk to us in the future about re-development
  of our site.
* Hamish Farrow is going to take over as Club President. Ranald is
  happy to stay involved.


Treasures Report:

(Judy McCowan)

* $26K in working account
* ANZ investment account $64K – new members bolsted this account.
* Great effort was put into making sure that all cabin bookings from
  last year were paid.
* The bills add up to about $10K a year. ( $4K for insurance )
* Most of the fixed costs are paid for by subscription fees
* We don't need more new members at this time.


Cabin Manager's Report:

(Peter Smith)

* No phone calls, emails, letters.
* Need to chase up Fire Services (form 10 and form 15).
* Labour Day (March 2007) Work Party. Tasks this year – clean up
  outside around the cabin, nail down the decking and oil, check the
  roof, check the ducts and heater fan, rats and mice control, clean
  toilets, rat proof the hot water room, put down lino in pantry and
  toilets and showers, re-stock misc supplies. Worker will be fed,
  please contact Peter Smith to confirm attendance for catering.
* We are only patching up the lodge to make it last for another 11
  years.



General Business:


* We can reduce the Telstra bill by returning the telstra handset and
  changing to a Homeline Budget account. Flynt has a friend who can
  sort it out. Do we need a fix line phone at all – safety issue and
  internet access.
* Formally introduce Flynt as a new member. (Junior to full member
  costs 3 times the annual subscription fee)
