Presidents Report:

(Ranald McCowan)

* Not much snow this year. Cabin attendance was very high given that
  there was little snow.
* Need to make sure it was used over the summer period as well. We
  have changed the summer rates to make it more attractive.
* Appartment sales on the mountain are not very strong.
* Thanks to the Treasurer and booking officer for keeping up with the
  winter bookings and payment.
* There are 2 officer bearer positions yet to be filled, may have to
  ask people more directly to take them on. (President and Cabin
  Manager).
* We have taken in 5 new members this year.
* We continue to cover our expenses with our subscription and cabin
  fees.
* We won't need to spend to much more on cabin workparties.


Treasures Report:

(Judy McCowan)

* Still do not have access to the ANZ account. Further paperwork was
  filled out tonight.
* Westpac has ~$27k (operating account) which really needs to be moved
  into the ANZ.
* Some of the new members have paid their joining fees into the ANZ
  account but this can not be confirmed as yet.
* Having difficulty contacting Greg McKern – Peter Smith will assist
  in locating him.
* Almost all subscription fees have been paid.
* Having difficulty in reconciling payments with bookings.
* It is unreasonable for people to have to pay for bookings if there
  is no snow. We need a “No Snow” policy.


“Not” the Cabin Manager's Report:

(Peter Smith)

* Refer to attached report and work_party documents.
* No complaints
* 2007 Labour Day work party – a few left over jobs.
* Gas Log Heater – Ingrid will be running a raffle to raise funds
* Peter Smith has remained as the first point of contact for Hotham
  Management
* Greg McKern has re-married
* Grant McKern has no further interest in the club
* We need to leave the pilot light on in the heater to stop it gumming
  up


General Business:


* Booking System


  1. We will decide on the 2007 cabin fees and booking policy at the
     December meeting.


* Other Business


  1. Do we need more new members given that the some McKerns are
     dropping out ? Leave the new memberships open for 1 more and we
     will consider the position at the December meeting.
