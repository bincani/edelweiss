Previous Meeting Minutes:
============================================================

Minutes of last AGM and last meeting. Proposed by Judy McCowan, 2nd
Bill Mitton.

Business Arising:
============================================================

* Telstra Phone is not working at all – we have an Telstra person
  coming to check it. Telstra fixed the wiring in January, and it was
  not working last week and Telsra says that it is their end. Andrew
  Grey says that the curtain is pulling at the wiring to the phone.
  Phone rental has been changed to home line basic.
* The Cabin Heater failed and has been replaced. Martin Brown will try
  to document the instructions for the new heater and email them to
  Bill Farrow to add to the Cabin Operating Instructions.


Correspondence:
============================================================

No correspondance.

Presidents Report:
============================================================

(Hamish Farrow)

* Thankyou to Ranald for his past work as President
* Attended the Hothem Management Comitee leaseholders meeting. They
  were very positive about the future of the mountain and the good ski
  season that we will have. They now have a sewrage recycling system
  to re-use the water for snow making. They see the survival of the
  mountain based on continued growth, especially in the basin area.
  There is a lot of pressure on the small clubs to grow, and the
  smaller clubs are disgruntled about this. A club has already been
  pushed off the mountain when their lease came up.
* We need to come up with a philosophy for what we want to be in 10
  years time. Are we going leave at the end of the lease, or sell our
  remaining leasehold earlier, or redevelop ?? There will be a
  decision made later on this year after the ski season, and members
  who want a say will need to attend or submit something in writing.
  There will be a mail out regarding this special meeting.
* Hamish would like to see a copy of our lease and our constitution.
  Does anyone have a copy of either of these documents ??
* We have lots of snow – 120cm of natural snow coverage.


Treasures Report:
============================================================

(Judy McCowan)

* Financial Report and Assets and Liabilities reports tabled. Compares
  this year with the last 5 years.
* The subscriptions are slightly down due to 2 members converting to
  Life Membership and 3 members being overseas.
* Interest in the ANZ was greater this year due to new members joining
  fees in the account.
* Gas was higher this year, perhaps due to the old heater.
* Last year we spent a lot on the cabin (new beds, etc).
* Next year Judy will need to cover some stationary costs.
* Current account balances: Westpac $18,183, ANZ $68,620
* Collecting Subscriptions last year was a hassle.
* Payments for Cabin bookings are becoming very hard to reconcile with
  payments not matching what is owed. Members need to email Judy and
  Bill when they make an online payment.
* We are doing well financially.
* We should continue with the $50 fee for members living permanently
  overseas.


Cabin Manager's Report:
============================================================

(Peter Smith)
Proposals from Peter Smith:

  1. That the club approve the expenditure of approximately $800.00 to
     purchase a Whirlpool Top loading commercial grade washing machine
     model number 6ALSQ8000MW. This machine has analogue controls (no
     digital) and appears to suit our needs, in particular the end of
     season washing of all bedding etc.
     Discussion about the possible miss use of the washing machine and
     leaving wet things in it when leaving the cabin. Leaving the
     responsibility to the last person leaving at the end of the
     season to do the washing would take up at lease a whole day of
     their vacation.
     Judy proposed that we get all of the linen commercially laundered
     once a year after the ski season. Judy voluntees to do this at
     the end of this ski season. We have decided not to have a washing
     machine at this time.
  2. That the club approves the purchase of an overhead cupboard for
     the laundry, I am suggesting 1200 wide x 600 high with 3 doors
     and the internal cupboards divided into three to affect safe
     storage of items should not be stored together. Furthermore, when
     stripping the hot water service room, now called the laundry, the
     locker belonging to the Mitton’s was destroyed and I suggest
     that one of three overhead cupboards be given to the Mitton’s
     in exchange.
     Bill Mitton said that he does not want any more storage. It was
     agreed that some storage is needed. The cupboard could now sit on
     the floor. This should be installed at the working bee next year.
     Proposed that a cupboard be installed but that it does not need
     to be overhead. Proposed Hamish, 2nd Judy.
  3. I am uncertain at this stage if I am going to be in Melbourne
     over the next couple of years and it may be time for the Cabin
     Manager’s position to change hands.
     See below for Election of Officer Bearers
  4. Apologies for Andrew and Michael as they usually either
     interstate or overseas flying. However, they have left me their
     Proxy’s when voting for items 1 and 2 above.


A report on the Easter work party at Edelweiss Ski Club.
Problems:

* It is noted that there was no dial tone on the telephone, we checked
  the line and it seems intact. Have we applied for disconnection?
* We have a problem with the gas oven rodents are able to gain access
  via the gas burners and in saying that I believe they may have
  damaged the self igniting function for oven relight. It has a safety
  circuit such that the gas will not continuously run unlit, however,
  it must be lit by matches or the gas gun. The fan and the light in
  the oven are also unserviceable. To repair the oven would require
  removal and taking off mountain to a service centre. I believe the
  solution is to purchase and install a 900mm wide electric oven, we
  have sufficient under bench space to allow this and it would also
  require the electrician to install a separate circuit. Or
  alternatively purchase a new gas cooktop with electric oven
  underneath. The cost is not going to be very much difference. With
  the current arrangement, we cannot keep the vermin out of the
  storage area under the oven and obviously if there is any food
  source they will inhabit the area.


Jobs completed as from Friday to Sunday :

* Second toilet installed and vinyl laid
* Old cistern area painted
* Glass shelf installed above wash basins for hand wash and toilet
  paper in both toilets
* Vinyl laid in shower rooms
* Siliconed gaps in walls next to showers in shower rooms
* Taps installed in laundry room including washing machine stops
* Splashback tiles laid around laundry trough
* Waste for laundry trough completed
* Architraves installed around doors in boot room
* New Cabin Operating Procedures will be issued shortly to reflect the
  above


All the above work was completed with the assistance of Martin Brown
who unfortunately was on crutches due to a squash injury earlier in
the week. Without Martin’s input only half of these jobs would have
been finished.
In attendance: Martin, Wendy, their sons Andrew and Matthew, and of
course Dorothy and myself.

Still outstanding:

* Vinyl in pantry – materials on site including glue and sufficient
  vinyl. The pre vinyl underlay is complete.
* Approval for purchase of washing machine
* Extra hand and towel rails (already purchased) to be installed in
  laundry, shower room and toilets
* Approval for purchase and installation of overhead cupboards for
  laundry
* As the cabin floor will probably vibrate with a washing machine
  operating, I have left a sheet of 20mm compacted cement sheet
  underneath the
* verandah which will serve as a solid base to mount the washing
  machine on. It will need trimming by 400mm by a large angle grinder
  to fit the floor space and to install will require bedding on wet
  brick mortar and levelling to compensate for the uneven floor. The
  sheet size 1200x785 and requires cutting to 800x785.
* The last area of consideration is reorganising the basement. With
  the influx of new members I believe the club has an obligation to
  supply space for members if they wish to supply their own locker. A
  locker size of 1800 high 350-380 wide and 460 deep seems to be
  standard and by my calculations we can fit an additional 14 lockers
  in this area. All we need to do is relocate the workbench to under
  the window and turn the stair case 90 degrees such as then lockers
  will fit against the heater and on the other side in that position
  currently occupied by the steel shelves. The cost is minimal most of
  the materials are on site except for the staircase which from an
  OH&S point of view needs rebuilding anyway. We can also tidy up the
  water supply valves such that the cold water drain is co-located to
  the hot water drain and is operated by one tap instead of two.


Outsourced items:

* Fire extinguishers bi annual inspection cost approximately $160.00
  to be completed by winter and to comply with Council requirements.
* Correspondence to Alpine Shire regarding pre season inspection of
  lodge, see previous correspondence.
* Electrician notified to change the battery in the Exit sign above
  the kitchen door and also to change switchboard wiring to reflect
  cabin operating procedures for the hot water service. As we now
  drain the hot water service on exit, there is no need for the hot
  water service power point to remain live when the cabin is
  electrically shut down.



General Business:
============================================================

* Bill Mitton proposes that we get rid of all lockers and make more
  room. Martin Brown disagrees, he is has stocked his locker ready for
  his winter trip, and carting everything in and out is a pain. Bill
  Mitton says that the area under the cabin is a dumping ground and he
  cleaned it out 2 years ago and it is full again this year. This will
  be delt with at the next meeting.
* Subscription Rates: Full Members $400 (up from $370), Spouse $60,
  Junior $60, overseas $50.
* Hamish proposes that look at raising the cabin fees at the next
  meeting.
* Hamish proposes that Peter Smith has an extra work party credit for
  use next year or for a family member.
* Do all members have a email address ? Judy will ask all members to
  provide email addresses along with the subscription payment
  invoices.
* Send Peter Smith a big thankyou for his tireless work as Cabin
  Manager.


Election of Office Bearers:
============================================================

* Andrew Grey for Cabin Manager – Proposed Hamish 2nd Bill Mitton.
  Passed.
* Hamish Farrow as President – Proposed Bill Mitton, 2nd Martin
  Brown
* Judy McCowan as Treasured – Proposed Hamish, 2nd Bill Mitton.
* Bill Farrow as Secretary – Proposed Hamish, 2nd Bill Mitton
