<P>Minutes of last AGM and last meeting. Proposed by Judy McCowan,
2<SUP>nd</SUP> Bill Mitton.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Business Arising:</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Telstra Phone is not working at all – we have an Telstra
	person coming to check it.  Telstra fixed the wiring in January, and
	it was not working last week and Telsra says that it is their end. 
	Andrew Grey says that the curtain is pulling at the wiring to the
	phone.  Phone rental has been changed to home line basic.</P>
	<LI><P>The Cabin Heater failed and has been replaced.  Martin Brown
	will try to document the instructions for the new heater and email
	them to Bill Farrow to add to the Cabin Operating Instructions.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Correspondence:</H2>
<P>No correspondance.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Presidents Report:</H2>
<P>(Hamish Farrow)</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Thankyou to Ranald for his past
	work as President</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Attended the Hothem Management
	Comitee leaseholders meeting.  They were very positive about the
	future of the mountain and the good ski season that we will have. 
	They now have a sewrage recycling system to re-use the water for
	snow making.  They see the survival of the mountain based on
	continued growth, especially in the basin area.  There is a lot of
	pressure on the small clubs to grow, and the smaller clubs are
	disgruntled about this.  A club has already been pushed off the
	mountain when their lease came up.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We need to come up with a
	philosophy for what we want to be in 10 years time.  Are we going
	leave at the end of the lease, or sell our remaining leasehold
	earlier, or redevelop ??  There will be a decision made later on
	this year after the ski season, and members who want a say will need
	to attend or submit something in writing.  There will be a mail out
	regarding this special meeting.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Hamish would like to see a copy of
	our lease and our constitution.  Does anyone have a copy of either
	of these documents ??</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We have lots of snow – 120cm of
	natural snow coverage.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Treasures Report:</H2>
<P>(Judy McCowan)</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Financial Report and Assets and Liabilities reports tabled.
	Compares this year with the last 5 years.
  <a href="Treasurers_Report_2006-2007.pdf">Attached PDF</a></P>
	<LI><P>The subscriptions are slightly down due to 2 members
	converting to Life Membership and 3 members being overseas.</P>
	<LI><P>Interest in the ANZ was greater this year due to new members
	joining fees in the account.</P>
	<LI><P>Gas was higher this year, perhaps due to the old heater.</P>
	<LI><P>Last year we spent a lot on the cabin (new beds, etc).</P>
	<LI><P>Next year Judy will need to cover some stationary costs.</P>
	<LI><P>Current account balances:  Westpac $18,183, ANZ $68,620</P>
	<LI><P>Collecting Subscriptions last year was a hassle.</P>
	<LI><P>Payments for Cabin bookings are becoming very hard to
	reconcile with payments not matching what is owed.  Members need to
	email Judy and Bill when they make an online payment.</P>
	<LI><P>We are doing well financially.</P>
	<LI><P>We should continue with the $50 fee for members living
	permanently overseas.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Cabin Manager's Report:</H2>
<P>(Peter Smith)</P>
<P>Proposals from Peter Smith:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">That the club approve the
	expenditure of approximately $800.00 to purchase a Whirlpool Top
	loading commercial grade washing machine model number 6ALSQ8000MW. 
	This machine has analogue controls (no digital) and appears to suit
	our needs, in particular the end of season washing of all bedding
	etc.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>Discussion about the possible miss
	use of the washing machine and leaving wet things in it when leaving
	the cabin.  Leaving the responsibility to the last person leaving at
	the end of the season to do the washing would take up at lease a
	whole day of their vacation.</I></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>Judy proposed that we get all of
	the linen commercially laundered once a year after the ski season. 
	Judy voluntees to do this at the end of this ski season.  We have
	decided not to have a washing machine at this time.</I></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">That the club approves the
	purchase of an overhead cupboard for the laundry, I am suggesting
	1200 wide x 600 high with 3 doors and the internal cupboards divided
	into three to affect safe storage of items should not be stored
	together.  Furthermore, when stripping the hot water service room,
	now called the laundry, the locker belonging to the Mitton’s was
	destroyed and I suggest that one of three overhead cupboards be
	given to the Mitton’s in exchange.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>Bill Mitton said that he does not
	want any more storage.  It was agreed that some storage is needed. 
	The cupboard could now sit on the floor.  This should be installed
	at the working bee next year.</I></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>Proposed that a cupboard be
	installed but that it does not need to be overhead. Proposed Hamish,
	2<SUP>nd</SUP> Judy.</I></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I am uncertain at this stage if I
	am going to be in Melbourne over the next couple of years and it may
	be time for the Cabin Manager’s position to change hands.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>See below for Election of Officer
	Bearers</I></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Apologies for Andrew and Michael
	as they usually either interstate or overseas flying.  However, they
	have left me their Proxy’s when voting for items 1 and 2 above.</P>
</OL>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">A report on the
Easter work party at Edelweiss Ski Club.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Problems:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is noted that there was no dial
	tone on the telephone, we checked the line and it seems intact.
	&nbsp;Have we applied for disconnection?</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We have a problem with the gas
	oven rodents are able to gain access via the gas burners and in
	saying that I believe they may have damaged the self igniting
	function for oven relight. &nbsp;It has a safety circuit such that
	the gas will not continuously run unlit, however, it must be lit by
	matches or the gas gun. &nbsp;The fan and the light in the oven are
	also unserviceable. To repair the oven would require removal and
	taking off mountain to a service centre. &nbsp;I believe the
	solution is to purchase and install a 900mm wide electric oven, we
	have sufficient under bench space to allow this and it would also
	require the electrician to install a separate circuit. &nbsp;Or
	alternatively purchase a new gas cooktop with electric oven
	underneath. &nbsp;The cost is not going to be very much difference.
	&nbsp;With the current arrangement, we cannot keep the vermin out of
	the storage area under the oven and obviously if there is any food
	source they will inhabit the area.</P>

was completed with the assistance of Martin Brown who unfortunately
was on crutches due to a squash injury earlier in the week. Without
Martin’s input only half of these jobs would have been finished.</P>

Dorothy and myself.</P>

<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Vinyl in pantry – materials on
	site including glue and sufficient vinyl. &nbsp;The pre vinyl
	underlay is complete.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Approval for purchase of washing
	machine</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Extra hand and towel rails
	(already purchased) to be installed in laundry, shower room and
	toilets</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Approval for purchase and
	installation of overhead cupboards for laundry</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As the cabin floor will probably
	vibrate with a washing machine operating, I have left a sheet of
	20mm compacted cement sheet underneath the</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">verandah which will serve as a
	solid base to mount the washing machine on. It will need trimming by
	400mm by a large angle grinder to fit the floor space and to install
	will require bedding on wet brick mortar and levelling to compensate
	for the uneven floor. &nbsp;The sheet size 1200x785 and requires
	cutting to 800x785.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The last area of consideration is
	reorganising the basement. &nbsp;With the influx of new members I
	believe the club has an obligation to supply space for members if
	they wish to supply their own locker. &nbsp;A locker size of 1800
	high 350-380 wide and 460 deep seems to be standard and by my
	calculations we can fit an additional 14 lockers in this area. &nbsp;All
	we need to do is relocate the workbench to under the window and turn
	the stair case 90 degrees such as then lockers will fit against the
	heater and on the other side in that position currently occupied by
	the steel shelves. &nbsp;The cost is minimal most of the materials
	are on site except for the staircase which from an OH&amp;S point of
	view needs rebuilding anyway. &nbsp;We can also tidy up the water
	supply valves such that the cold water drain is co-located to the
	hot water drain and is operated by one tap instead of two.</P>

	battery in the Exit sign above the kitchen door and also to change
	switchboard wiring to reflect cabin operating procedures for the hot
	water service. &nbsp;As we now drain the hot water service on exit,
	there is no need for the hot water service power point to remain
	live when the cabin is electrically shut down.</P>

	proposes that we get rid of all lockers and make more room.  Martin
	Brown disagrees, he is has stocked his locker ready for his winter
	trip, and carting everything in and out is a pain.  Bill Mitton says
	that the area under the cabin is a dumping ground and he cleaned it
	out 2 years ago and it is full again this year.  This will be delt
	with at the next meeting.</P>
