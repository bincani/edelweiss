Presidents Report

1. Mathew Gray

Correspondence received from Peter Smith, Peter Twomey , Martin Brown,
and discussion with Bill Mitton.

The intention of the President is to have an objective two person
membership committee to review Mathew's membership as this has been
drawn into question. I have asked Andrew to inform Mathew this is
happening, and hold off Mathew presenting at a meeting until this is
resolved; and the committee will have discussions with him in due
course as well as any others involved  with a resolution by the
next meeting.

The President invites confidential submissions regarding this matter,
but will only be taking factual statements into consideration, not
hearsay.

2. Francina's aborted stay

Francina's recent stay was cut short due to the requirement for
repairs etc to heater and hot water service, despite the service agent
looking at the heater in May.

The Cabin Manager will outline the details of the equipment failures
and steps taken in his report.   The President is of the view that the
club takes payment for bookings on the understanding it will supply a
particular level of accommodation and this wasn't met so
feels that the Club should refund the fees for this stay.
Proposed Hamish Farrow and Judy McCowan Seconded, Carried

Note: Plumber is Scott McNair 0407 534 410

Judy raised the issue of the cabin operating instructions Martin
will update and forward to Bill who will add final version to the
website.

3. Apparent use of the club without bookings

* It is understood that Mathew Gray stayed last year (2011)
  under Alicia's booking in August whilst she wasn't present.
* May 2012 discovery of the broken window in the double bed
  room by Martin Brown.  
* July 2012 - Francina noted the bunkrooms were not vacuumed.
  Martin Brown was the last book and stay and had vacuumed the
  entire lodge.

It seems we have to face the idea that someone is gaining access to
the club presumably using the keyed lock and thus presumably
family or close associate of a club member, which is most
disappointing. The President confirmed that this would be seen as a
direct contravention of the club's rules and knowingly allowing this
would constitute grounds for loss of membership.

The President is treating this matter most seriously and asks all
members to ensure their keys are kept in a secure location.
In the event that this does not solve the situation of possible copied
keys, the possibility of other systems of gaining entry warrant
discussion such as leaving a master key at Resort Management ,
adding a combination lock to the front door (which also allows for
kids to return earlier) and change the combo twice a year with the
number provided on booking.

Ingrid suggested police surveillance, Andrew suggest secure non-copy
keys.

Sandy suggests a call to loyalty from club membership, and failing
this being effective get secure keys. Also we should use the club more
and then the issue may be alleviated.

4. Late Membership fees

Alicia Gray's membership fees were not paid till her booking was
questioned after having had notice via Andrew Gray that she didn't
want her membership (mentioned in minutes Feb 2012). All paid in
full since and thus Alicia Gray retains her membership.

Snow - we have so much more than Buller - Yeah!

Treasurer's report
Judy cut out from Westpac online, which is being corrected.
Hamish Farrow to be a signatory for the account and authorise Judy to
operate
Proposed Sandy Clark, Martin Brown seconded, Carried.

Ingrid adds that Katrina Mitton is thinking of resigning her
membership.

Cabin Manager's Report
Heater - broken twice after repair - some issue with water leak
into the heater ruining the sensors - working now and on.

Gas Valve - issue with the pin valve at the back of the cabin
Martin will ensure that is in the operating instructions

HWS - not working and sent to Wangaratta - will get replaced now
- by the end of the week

Tumble dryer - dead and Chris Mitton has offered one to replace

Trimming done around the lodge as planned.

Proposed Martin Brown, Judy McCowan seconded, Carried.

Redevelopment   Update
Peri - Have engaged a building surveyor, Stokes Perna, for advice
and assessment of the site. This draft report will be forthcoming.
Re: Compliance with BCA - we can alter up to 50% without having to
reassess the whole building for compliance. This requires less than
25% increase in floor space, but also structural integrity, and will
also need a BCA report of existing building. The structural adequacy
of the existing building may be an issue.

The staged development currently proposed includes: Stage 1 -
bathrooms then internal repositioning of bedrooms and Stage 2 - would
not fit within a BCA compliance partial assessment.
Next step is an engineer/builder (one is at Dinner Plain) to assess
the structural situation, and see if it is reasonable to rebuild or
refurbish the cabin.

Moving forward 
If the cabin is structurally sound then a refurbishment is an option,
if not then a new structure will be required.  The most viable
option will be costed, then the club will determine how we pay for
this. Then proceed.
Proposed Peri Mc Donald, John Guise seconded, Carried.

General Business
Marga - we need a membership drive - we would certainly take on
members.

History of the club - Joanna Jackson will ask Kate Jackson for her
Thesis on Edelweiss.
