	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Thankyou to those people who have
	worked on the cabin and club matters: cabin manager, the bookings
	officer, treasurer.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This has been a big year,
	significan cabin working parties, new members.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Future of the club, and the need
	to redevelop the cabin. The Financial review had a article on Alpine
	developments. There is less and less unencoumbered land for
	development. The Maritz developers were very happy to talk with us
	for perhaps a future development on out site (in about 3 years).
	There is another development group who built “Husky” at Falls
	Creek. We have to know what it is that we want to do. We will have
	to keep working on this, and should establish an ongoing
	subcommittee for this to keep continuity with the developers.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The finanial health of the club –
	we have to live within our means. This year we have spent more on
	things such as re-carpeting. We need to scale back on our
	expenditures, and increase our cabin stays.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">People are making their bookings
	but are not paying their deposit, please pay your deposit on time.</P>

	end of the mountain.</P>
